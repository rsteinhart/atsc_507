Q2) Triangular Spectral Truncation is used with highest order N=1279. 
Meaning that there are 1280 truncation points.
Warner has the same maximum wavenumber of 1279. 

Warner's four equations are:
$L_{1}= \frac{2\pi a}{3K + 1},L_{2} =\frac{\pi a}{K},  L_{3}=\frac{2\sqrt{\pi}a}{K+1},L_{4}=\frac{\sqrt{2}\pi a}{K}$
 
With a spectral resolution of 799 L1 = 16.7km, L2 = 25.0 km, L3 = 28.2, L4 = 35.4km
ECMWF uses this equation:
$L=\frac{2\pi a}{n}$


with the same spectral resolution of 799 L = 50.10km
The ECMWF equation is most similar to L2 but the value is quite a bit larger than any of the values for L1-L4.
